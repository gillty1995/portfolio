       "One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning how to implement Auth0 for authentication, as I typically use JWT for user verification. Auth0 introduced a different approach to handling authentication, requiring me to understand how it manages user sessions, tokens, and API authorization. Initially, figuring out how to retrieve and manage user data across the frontend and backend was a bit of a learning curve. However, once I grasped the Auth0 flow‚Äîincluding login, logout, and token verification‚Äîit became much easier to integrate seamlessly into my application!¬†",
