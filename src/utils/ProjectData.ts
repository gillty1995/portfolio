      details: `<p><strong>Around the U.S.</strong> is a responsive web project designed to display content seamlessly across all popular screen sizes. Using modular JavaScript components, I implemented features that allow users to interact with the interface in a dynamic, intuitive way.</p>
      
      <p>The project structure reflects a commitment to clean code practices, utilizing BEM for consistent styling and OOP principles to ensure maintainability. Through the use of an organized CSS structure and a JavaScript-based API, the site is not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly.</p>`
